          <p>In 1911, only 186 people living in Victoria had been born in the Netherlands. Out of a total population of approximately 1.3 million people, it was an understandably miniscule percentage of the population. </p>
<p>Back then, migration took many months by boat, was astronomically expensive compared to what those seeking passage could afford, and was an extremely perilous business to boot. But more to the point, there was no serious reason for the Dutch people to even consider migrating at all, much less to a place as far off and distant as Australia.</p>
<p>That all changed on May 10, 1940, when Germany launched a surprise invasion in the early days of the war. Five days and over five thousand deaths later, over half of them civilians, and Holland was a Nazi-occupied nation.</p>

<p>Cornelia van de Ven, known to all as Corry, was nine when her world was turned upside-down. To put that into perspective, that’s a year and a half younger than Anne Frank.</p>
<p>Together with her father, her mother, her one younger (Dora) and thirteen- yes, thirteen- elder siblings, Corry grew up in the small farming village of Beek en Donk, 20 kilometres away from the nearest city, Eindhoven.</p>
<p>Being born in the south of the country, Corry was fortuitous. Growing up as part of an agricultural community, she and her fellow townspeople managed to avoid the widespread food shortages that hit the Netherlands in the later years of occupation, culminating in the Dutch famine of 1944-45 that saw 30,000 starve to death in a single winter. So too was she lucky, in that liberation for her and the other southern provinces of the country came far sooner than for their northern counterparts. Remarkably, all 15 of the van de Vens survived into adulthood and had children of their own.</p>

          <br>
<p>But perils were as much a part of life as was Sunday mass and card games. The invaders were a constant menace, but almost as significant was the impact from other forces. On 6 December, 1942, an RAF air raid target Eindhoven’s Philips factory ended the lives of 148 people. But even that pales in comparison to the bombing raids the Germans inflicted on the city on September 19, 1944, the very day after British forces had liberated the city. </p>
<p>A total of 227 lives were lost on that day alone. A hefty price for freedom.</p>

          <br>
  <p>Throughout all this, and so much more, did Corry and her fellow future Dutch migrants endure and survive. Her childhood was framed against a backdrop of Nazi occupation. The constant marching of boots, the yelling of orders and the cruelty of the soldiers never left her. But the ecstasy of liberation never did, either. Corry, this author’s grandmother, was often wont to express her love for an English accent, for it reminded her of her saviours, all those years ago.</p>

          <p> <font face="times new roman" size="3" color="#000000"><i>Place: The Netherlands, Western Europe; Melbourne, Australia</p>

<br>
<p>It took a further nine months after the southern regions of the Netherlands were freed from German occupation for the country to be fully liberated. But the end of the war did not mean the end of tribulation.</p>
<p> Like most of Europe, the Netherlands struggled through torrid economic times in the years immediately following the war. Not only had valuable infrastructure been destroyed, perhaps most notably bridges and roads on important goods-delivering routes, but thanks to multiple bombing raids from both the Germans and Allied forces, the number of houses still standing was also a major concern. When you add that to the emotional and physical trauma many were still suffering, it was a dark time for Holland.</p>
<p>Faced with these shortages, the Netherlands government did the only thing possible: actively encouraged their citizens to emigrate to alleviate the strain on the local economy. </p>
<p>And the Dutch people were only too keen to oblige.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular migration destinations in the fifteen years following the war were the United States, Canada, England and South Africa. Corry rejected the first three because of the cold weather, while South Africa missed out due to safety concerns (“No way is that place stable” she is rumoured to have said).</p>
<p>But there was another country which had become a haven for Dutch migrants, where, thanks to a shortage of agricultural and metal-working labourers, the local government was actively encouraging fleeing Europeans to choose them.</p>
<p>So in early 1955, Corry, along with fiancée Johannes van Otterdyk, known to all as Joop (pronounced Yope), boarded the Johan van Oldenbarnvelt, one of the most famous Dutch migrant ships, having paid their own fares and with just 25 pounds in their pocket, and headed on their way to Australia.</p>
<br>
          <div class="row-md-8" align="top"><img src="images/1930-1959/33.jpg" align="center" width="500" height="500" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
          </div>
          <br>
<p>A little over a month later, they had arrived in Perth. A little after that, and they had reached Melbourne, where Johannes’ cousin, Frans, lived. By the end of the year, they were married.</p>
<p>And in two years’ time, they had already had their first child (named Rolph) and had built on a small block of land in Greensborough. It would remain Corry’s home for nearly sixty years.</p>
<br>
          <div class="row-md-8" align="top"><img src="images/1930-1959/57.jpg" align="center" width="500" height="500" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
          </div>
          <br>
<p>It was at this time that the Dutch Club Abel Tasman first opened its doors. More on them later.</p>
<p>The challenge to assimilate whilst still preserving their Dutch heritage was a struggle for the van Otterdyks, made only more difficult when Rolph reached school-going age. </p>
<p>Having grown up speaking only Dutch, Rolph’s first day at kindergarten, where his inability to translate the foreign language being spoken by his classmates led to some well-timed fisticuffs of frustration- basically, he punched another kid because he couldn’t understand their English- is the stuff of folklore in the family even today.</p>
<p>But it also was precisely the moment when assimilation trumped preservation in the van Otterdyk household. Their next three children (Marcel, Charlotta and Bartho, all born between 1959 and 1964) would all grow up speaking English, and to this day only the very basics of the Dutch language are remembered by any of them. Even Corry would eventually come to forget much of her native language as the years went passed, though her thick accent remained as strong as ever.</p>
<br>
          <div class="row-md-8" align="top"><img src="images/1930-1959/65.jpg" align="center" width="500" height="500" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
          </div>
          <br>

<p>But their efforts paid off, for in 1968, both Corry and Johannes became naturalised Australian citizens. The process required them both to relinquish their Dutch citizenship, and while Corry was at first hesitant to do so, she remarked with pride, “I am an Australian now” when her new identity was finalised.</p>
<p>As the newly Australianised van Otterdyks continued to build their new family in the early 1970s, Jan and Mieke Bylstra were embarking on a migration of their own.</p>
<p>Economic conditions had drastically improved in the Netherlands in the previous decade, but for the newly married Jan, there was still a reason to move away.</p>
<p>“I found it a bit small in Holland,” Jan explains.</p>
<p>“Particularly on weekends, when you want to go to the beach, you’re in the car for hours on end. I thought, there must be a better way of living.”</p>
<p>Having arranged the transfer through Jan’s Netherlands workplace, the Bylstras’ migration was less stressful than most. The ocean voyage was completed on company dime, and thanks to a relative in Melbourne, finding an apartment in South Yarra was no trouble at all.</p>
<p>But that’s not to say the adjustment to Melbourne life wasn’t without its challenges.</p>
<p>“When we rented our first flat, the real estate agent said, ‘Oh, this is good, because you’re close to the train station, you’re close to the tram and you’re close to a bus’,” Jan recalls.</p>
<p>“And I said, well, the train will be good enough for me. But at the time there were a lot of strikes, you see, so she said ‘No, if one goes on strike you can always take the other one.’</p>
<p>“And sure enough,” Jan laughs, “we were only in the place for about a month or so, and we had our first train strike.”</p>
<p>Assimilation was also an important factor for the Bylstras. For many years, they avoided any contact with the local Dutch community groups, because, in Mieke’s words, “We wanted to become Australian”. And their only child, and her children in turn, were brought up speaking only English, in almost a carbon copy of the van Otterdyks’ own approach.</p>
<p>“They don’t exactly speak the language, because we didn’t teach them,” Mieke says.</p>
<p>“And that was common in that time. You integrate with Australia, your children have to go to school and university, so you find it important that they learn good English.”</p>
<p>Jan nods thoughtfully. “Maybe that was a mistake in the end, but at the time everyone was saying you shouldn’t do that, because that way they don’t learn both languages properly.”</p>
<p>Thanks to their English skills, the second and third generations of Dutch-Australians are now impossible to pick out by merely speaking to them. And as the number of Netherlands-born migrants dwindled from over 36,000 near the end of the 1950s to just 21,000 by 2011, so too has the history, and the culture, of the Netherlands slowly drifted away from the public consciousness.</p>

<p>On 10 May, 1998, having been separated from Corry for a decade, Johannes van Otterdyk passed away of a heart attack. And just last year, Corry followed suit.</p>
<p>This author only discovered the full extent of his grandmother’s story at her funeral.</p>
<p>I won’t pretend that that doesn’t hurt me just a little bit.</p>

<br>
<p>Today, Melbourne is regarded as a cultural melting pot, where races, religions and colours from all across the world live and breathe. But thanks to their successful assimilation into Australian society from the moment they first stepped onto the dock, Dutch culture is seldom if ever considered one of the primary ingredients.</p>
<p>So why do we forget? Perhaps party because the Dutch diaspora never settled in one particular part of Melbourne. Where Richmond is famous for its Vietnamese community, and 29 per cent of Box Hill’s population were born in China, there is no one suburb in the city that has been entirely “Dutchified”.</p>
<p>Some, like the van Otterdyks, headed to the north-east and Greensborough, while others, like Jan and Mieke, headed south to Mount Waverley, where they reside today.</p>
<p>A little of everywhere, but not enough anywhere to be noticeable.</p>
<p>Another important factor is the amount of Dutch migrants who married non-Dutch partners. Jan and Mieke, and Corry and Johannes, are the exceptions to the rule: 57.7% of first generation Dutch men and 38.3% of Dutch women married partners from elsewhere upon arriving in Australia; by contrast, just 33.8% of Italian men and 9.6% of women do the same.</p>
<p>Thanks to their huge success in becoming part of the Melbourne furniture, the culture of the Netherlands that was brought over with such abundance in the post-war period is now being slowly watered down in this city. That is why the efforts of community clubs like the Erasmus Foundation and the Dutch Club Abel Tasman are more important than ever, to ensure the candle doesn’t completely blow out.</p>
<br>
          <div class="row-md-8" align="top"><img src="images/slider3-crop-u5604.jpg" align="center" width="500" height="500" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
          </div>
          <br>
<p>Formed in 1958, the Abel Tasman has changed locations several times, starting out in St Kilda before moving to Elwood in the early 1970s, before finally settling down in Carnegie by 1972.</p>
<p>But its sentiment remains the same: to act as a meeting place for people with Dutch heritage to sit, chat and maybe enjoy a <i>Hollandse nieuwe haring</i> or two. And above all, to keep the Dutch culture alive and well in Melbourne.</p>
<p>As the convenor of the Erasmus Foundation, which aims to promote an understanding and friendship between the cultures of Australia and the Netherlands, as well as a committee member at the Abel Tasman, Jan is in charge of organising events for the Melbourne Dutch Community, notably a yearly Dutch film showing at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI).</p>
<br>
          <div class="row-md-8" align="top"><img src="images/jan.jpg" align="center" width="500" height="500" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
          </div>
          <br>
<p>He also does his bit for the cause by organising speakers to give talks at the two clubs, with a native Dutch heritage particularly desirable.</p>
<p>“We are trying, as much as we can, to bring Dutch culture here, by trying to find people with Dutch backgrounds, speaker-wise,” he says.</p>
<p>“We’ve found that when you get speakers in with a Dutch background, that gives a bit more emphasis that we are that cultural Dutch club, rather than just any rotary club or something like that.”</p>
<p>It took a chance encounter with a parent at their child’s school, Mac.Robertson Girls’ High School, to give Jan the push he needed to become a major part of the Dutch community in Melbourne. Thanks to his hard work, Dutch culture continues to carry on.</p>
<p>And for people like this author with a Dutch heritage worth remembering, and even for those with a connection to Melbourne, the city they embraced like New Holland reborn, that is a very welcome thing indeed.</p>

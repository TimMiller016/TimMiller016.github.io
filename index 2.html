                  <p>It’s fair to say that Jan Bylstra is a pretty significant figure in the Dutch community.</p>
                  <div class="container-fluid">
                    <div class="row">
                      <div class="center"><img src="images/tent.png"
           class="img-responsive img-rounded"
           style:"float:right;margin:0 0 0 0;"  />

                                          <p > For twenty years, he has been heavily involved with the Erasmus Foundation, a leading Dutch-Australian cultural society aiming to preserve Dutch culture and community bonds in Victoria.
He’s also recently become a committee member at the Dutch Club Abel Tasman, the state’s most widely known community group for the thousands of migrants that travelled from the Netherlands, also known as Holland, to Australia during the period of European financial turmoil following the Second World War. </p> </div>
<p> Yet for years, Jan and his wife Mieke, who this year celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary, distanced themselves completely from such outward celebrations of their heritage. </p>
<p> “We did not have any interest, not at all [when we first migrated],” Mieke says, reclining slightly in her favourite position on the couch in their home in Mount Waverley.
“We wanted to become Australian.” </p>
<p>Jan agrees. “A lot of people do that; they say 'Well, we’re here now, we’ll try to assimilate into the Australian landscape'.”</p>
<p>“A lot of Dutch are like that,” Mieke adds.</p>
<div class="row-md-8" align="top"><img src="images/jan.jpg" align="center" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
</div>
<p align="bottom">Jan and Mieke aren’t wrong: indeed, if there is one thing the Dutch community does better than perhaps any other migrant group, it’s integrate into their new home with a minimum of fuss.
So thoroughly and effectively have they blended into Australian society and culture that not only does Dutch blood pop up in the unlikeliest of places in Victoria- would you believe that this author, with his quintessentially British name of Timothy Miller, is indeed half-Dutch himself?- but often, the story of their arrival in Australia, and the many hardships they endured both before and after their migration, is lost to the history books. </p>
<p>You might not know, for example, that of all the countries classified as belonging to Western Europe, no country suffered greater losses per capita than the Netherlands. Or that in the 13 years between 1947 and 1960, the Dutch population in Victoria increased from 625 to 36,284 (a jump of almost 6000 per cent).</p>
<p>Jan and Mieke were, in many ways, lucky. Both were born in the final days of the Second World War, and met and married long enough after it for the Netherlands to have neared the end of the healing process after the great devastation that left more than 200,000 of its citizens dead. And as such, their desire to move was not one borne of desperation, but of lifestyle. </p>
<p>“It was more living conditions than economy-wise, because I had a job in Holland, so there was no reason to leave at all,” Jan explains. </p>
<p>This author’s grandparents, among many thousands of others, were not quite so fortunate.</p>
